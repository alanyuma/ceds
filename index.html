                <p>The communities of the Western Arizona Economic Development District (the <i>‘District’</i>) possess considerable development potential, both in expanding their existing economic base sectors and in diversifying their economies.</p>

                <p>There are also severe constraints to development that affect every community.</p>

                <p>The communities of the Western Arizona Economic Development District (the <i>‘District’</i>) possess considerable development potential, both in expanding their existing economic base sectors and in diversifying their economies.</p>

                <p>There are also severe constraints to development that affect every community.</p>

                <p>Limitations are almost invariably externally imposed. Existing federal and state policies and practices regarding establishing highway service levels, siting of higher education facilities, making land available for local community development, etc., all severely disadvantage District communities.</p>

                <p>The District’s communities will continue to see rapid growth over the coming decade and beyond. Economic diversification and development are needed to assure that the impact of growth is positive, our communities stay livable, and our residents and businesses enjoy prosperity.</p>

                <p>Unlike some cities in other areas, District communities do not need to, and may not desire to promote growth. Economic development measures must control and direct that growth into definite channels.</p>

                <p>The success of these strategies will depend on many factors. These will include local government willingness to proactively address growth and development issues, a continuation of regional and local planning efforts, and good relations and cooperation between local governments, businesses, educational institutions, and labor.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, critical components of development strategies lie outside of local control. State policies regarding higher educational institutions, funding for schools, workforce training programs, making state lands available for development, and providing adequate highway access to District communities may cripple even the most dedicated development programs.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, regional development and the livability of our communities may depend on our ability to change state and federal policies that adversely impact our communities and their development.</p>

                <p>It is <em><strong>essential</strong></em> for rural communities to plan their economic growth in a way that complements and leverages their existing assets.</p>

                <p>The District area includes three counties in Arizona: La Paz, Mohave and Yuma; ten cities and towns: Yuma, Somerton, San Luis, Wellton, Parker, Quartzsite, Kingman, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Colorado City; and six reservations wholly or partly in the District: Quechan, Cocopah, Colorado Indian Tribes, Fort Mohave, Hualapai, and Kaibab-Paiute.</p>

                <p>The District stretches from Mexico on the South to Nevada and Utah on the North and is bounded by California and Nevada on the West.</p>

                <p>The District covers 23,519 square miles. Most of the western border is demarcated by the Colorado River. Most communities are on or near the Colorado River.</p>

                <p>All three Counties and eight of the ten Cities and Towns have chosen to participate in and support the District formally.</p>

                        <p><strong>Environmental Impacts</strong></p>

                        <p>Environmental concerns can be viewed as falling into two categories, Colorado River and Other.

                            <p>Environmental concerns cluster around the larger communities and are typical of urban issues such as air quality and the finding of ground pollution from past uses when environmental regulations were less strict.</p>

                            <p>The level of the problems is moderate, and no significant concerns that would restrict development are currently at issue.</p>

                            <p>Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (MCAS Yuma) occupies approximately 3,000 acres within the City and County of Yuma, Arizona.</p>

                            <p>The City of Yuma, the nearest municipality, is located about one mile northwest of the Station.

                                <p>Both the City and the Station obtain their drinking water from the Colorado River through an irrigation canal.</p>

                                <p>The City does not use groundwater for drinking water purposes. The nearest domestic underground well is approximately 0.8 miles downgradient from the Station.</p>

                                <p>MCAS Yuma's mission is to provide services and materials support operations to the Marine Aircraft Wing and its subordinate units.</p>

                                <p>In 1990, MCAS Yuma was placed on the Superfund National Priorities List after chlorinated solvents were detected in a groundwater monitoring well on the Station.</p>

                                <p>Starting in the mid-1940s, waste fuels and solvents from the refueling and servicing of airplanes were reportedly disposed of directly onto the ground or into unlined pits at the Station site.</p>

                                <p>Besides, combustible materials such as fuel oil and organic solvents were deposited on the ground or burned during fire training exercises. Approximately 5,700 people live on-site.</p>

                                <p>In the past, during maintenance work on the Colorado River irrigation canal which took place for two weeks each year, drinking water was supplemented using an on-station well. However, this practice was stopped in August 1995.</p>

                                <a id="natural_resources"></a>
                                <p><strong>Natural Resources</strong></p>

                                <p>Primary natural resources include climate, isolation, some mineral deposits, and the Colorado River.</p>

                                <p>Primary man-made resources include a series of dams on the Colorado River, their related irrigation systems, and the East/West transportation corridors. Mineral deposits in the region include gold, silver, copper, feldspar, and molybdenum, all of which have been found in Mohave County.</p>

                                <p>Some gold deposits are also located in La Paz County. Mining and mineral processing are not currently major economic activities within the region but were prominent in the past in Mohave County.</p>

                                <p>For mining and mineral processing to become essential contributors to the local economies would probably require the discovery of significant new mineral deposits.</p>

                                <p>Dams and diversions on the Colorado River within the District include Hoover, Davis, Parker, Palo Verde, Laguna, and Imperial.</p>

                                <p>Barriers create potentials for power generation, irrigation, and recreation and all are essential resources for the District’s communities.</p>

                                <p>The combination of Colorado River reservoirs, warm and dry climate, and convenient east/west highways have developed a strong tourist industry directed towards water-related recreation in the District.

                                    <p>Communities, where this industry is particularly important, include Parker, Lake Havasu, and Bullhead City.</p>

                                    <p>Where water-related relaxation is a central portion of the tourist trade, it creates opportunities for year-round tourism, some recreation-oriented tourism, ‘snow birds’ and RVers in the winter, significant water-related recreation in the summer.</p>

                                    <p>Tourists focused on water sports also tend to be more affluent than the snowbird/RV group and create options for a more lucrative upscale tourist industry.</p>

                                    <p>The river and dams also enable the District’s agriculture. The arid climate makes farming impossible without irrigation. Of the District’s more than 325,000 acres of cropland, more than 93% is irrigated.</p>

                                    <p>The dams and related irrigation systems are what make the agricultural industries in Yuma and La Paz Counties viable. A unique advantage of the District of farming activities is it's ‘reversed’ growing season.</p>

                                    <p>The primary growing season is winter when the climate moderates to temperatures that in other areas are typical of summer. Yuma County thus produces much of the country’s winter vegetables, especially iceberg lettuce.</p>

                                    </figure>

                                    <p>The District area includes three counties in Arizona: Yuma, La Paz, and Mohave; ten cities and towns: Yuma, Somerton, San Luis, Wellton, Parker, Quartzsite, Kingman, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Colorado City; and six reservations wholly or partly in the District: Quechan, Cocopah, Colorado Indian Tribes, Fort Mohave, Hualapai, and Kaibab-Paiute.</p>

                                    <p>The District stretches from Mexico on the South to Nevada and Utah on the North and is bounded by California and Nevada on the West.</p>

                                    <p>The District covers 23,519 square miles.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the western border is demarcated by the Colorado River.</p>

                                    <p>Most communities are on or near the Colorado River.</p>

                                    <p>All three Counties and eight of the ten Cities and Towns have chosen to participate in and support the District formally.</p>

                                    <p>The geography and climate of the District range from low elevations, flat plains, small mountains, and arid environment in Southwestern Yuma County to higher mountains receiving moderate amounts of rain in northeastern Mohave County.</p>

                                    <p>Elevations range from barely above sea level to more than 5,000 feet.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the area along the Colorado River, as most of the District, is arid and adequately classified as desert.</p>

                                    <p>Rainfall varies from little more than two inches per year in Yuma to about 16 inches per year in parts of Mohave County.</p>

                                    <p>The climate is sweltering throughout most of the District, with Yuma and Lake Havasu having recorded high temperatures of 127 and 128 respectively.</p>

                                    <p>Temperatures moderate some in northeastern Mohave County, with light winter snows in Kingman and a somewhat colder climate in the Colorado City area, which is at a higher elevation.</p>

                                    <p>The Colorado River Valley contains significant agricultural development, dependent upon irrigation.</p>

                                    <p>Yuma County is Arizona’s principal agrarian producer, and agriculture is also substantial in La Paz County.</p>

                                    <p>The more than 1,000 miles of shoreline on the Colorado River and associated bodies of water make the District an outstanding area for water-related recreation as well.</p>

                                    <p>Yuma’s agribusiness sector is responsible for supplying the United States with 80 percent of its winter, leafy vegetables.</p>

                                    <p>A variety of industrial, processing and logistics operations take advantage of Yuma's strategic location, increasing Yuma's economic diversity.</p>

                                    <p>The Mexican free-port of San Luis Rio Colorado is located 23 miles southwest, luring industries interested in offshore manufacturing, or twin-plant operations.</p>

                                    <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, if Yuma County were a country, its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) would rank 151 out of 192 countries. Yes, that's countries.</p>

                                    <p>GDP is defined as the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a region's borders. Yuma's GDP for 2012 was calculated at nearly $5.4 billion.</p>

                                    <p>The government contributed $1.5 billion and private industries $3.8 billion. The three most significant sectors in the Yuma economy are agriculture, military, and tourism.</p>

                                    <p>Undisputedly, agriculture is the number one industry for Yuma County.</p>

                                    <p>This is due to our fertile soil (sediments deposited by the Colorado River over millions of years), progressive farmers (who explore and utilize the laest theories and technology in their fields), sufficient labor (highly skilled and motivated workforce) and senior rights to irrigation water.</p>

                                    <p>Lettuce is the largest winter crop in Yuma, it is by no means the only one. There are over 175 different crops grown in the Yuma area year round! The list includes alfalfa, Bermuda grass seed, cotton, dates, lemons, melons, and wheat.</p>

                                    <p>Desert Durum accounts for 95% of the wheat grown in Yuma County, and about two-thirds of that is exported to Italy for use in making premium pasta.</p>

                                    <p>Dates are a remarkable fruit and are another essential piece of the Yuma Ag industry, just like all the other vegetables grown here.</p>

                                    <p>As long as people need to eat, farmers will continue to keep Agriculture the leading sector in Yuma.</p>

                                    <strong>Food Processing</strong>

                                    <p>Food processing is a logical extension of Yuma’s agricultural industry. Food processing plants can locate within proximity of agricultural production.</p>

                                    <strong>Yuma County</strong>

                                    <p>More than $45 million in both public and private funding have been invested in Yuma International Airport over the past ten years.</p>

                                    <p>Some of that $45 million has funded improvements to runways, taxiways, and parking aprons, the terminal and other infrastructure to benefit the flying public.</p>

                                    <p>However, much of the focus has been on developing the west side of the airport into the Defense Contractor Complex to provide facilities for both short- and long-term leasing by defense contractors working to support the missions of Yuma's two military installations: Yuma Proving Ground and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (with critical national defense missions), as well as aviation giants including Boeing, GE Aviation, Gulfstream, Honda Jet, NASA, Pratt &amp; Whitney and US Customs and Border Protection.</p>

                                    <p>Those dollars have created construction jobs, and hundreds of vital permanent jobs provided new tax revenue sources and represent an investment in the future of the community that promises to deliver economic development and job creation well into the future. The airport also is an active participant in efforts to market and promote the Yuma area.</p>

                                    <p>The continuation of economic expansion in Yuma County continues to drive economic development strategies for market development aimed at four diversified industries with the highest growth potential. Aviation is one such commercial industry.</p>

                                    <p>The Yuma International Airport and Yuma County Airport Authority work closely with the decision-makers in the aerospace industry, other government agencies, and academic institutions to coordinate business development.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to commercial, general, and military flight operations, Yuma International Airport also has a definite talent for air transport, limited aircraft maintenance, airport service, and flight training.</p>

                                    <p>Public program funds help local governments and airport authorities to plan, design, build and maintain public aviation facilities.</p>

                                    <p>An example of an economic development project is an industrial park's facilities at a general airport.</p>

                                    <p>Commercial and general aviation plays a crucial role in stimulating economic growth, employment, and investment in the United States.</p>

                                    <p>There are more than 5,000 US public airports, and fewer than 500 have a commercial airline server, which makes commercial and general aviation very important.</p>

                                    <p>Yuma is home to two of the largest military installations in the United States.</p>

                                    <p>Marine Corps Air Station Yuma is the country’s foremost Marine Air Base with an estimated population of more than 7,500 pilots, aviation technicians, and aeronautical mechanics.</p>

                                    <p>Thousands more that travel there for training, the air base serves as an integral part of the Yuma economy.</p>

                                    <p>With the arrival of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, the military’s future in Yuma is bright.</p>

                                    <p>The U.S. Army first came to the area in 1851 and established Fort Yuma on Indian Hill.</p>

                                    <p>The installation overlooked the Yuma Crossing, the aptly named low spot in the Colorado River, and it allowed for the establishment of the townsite of what would later become Yuma.</p>

                                    <p>In 1864 the US Army put up the Quartermaster Depot along the river. From here the US Army oversaw the distribution of supplies to soldiers in the West.</p>

                                    <p>MCAS Yuma has the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and Yuma Proving Ground has the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.</p>

                                    <p>The purpose of the military free-fall facility will allow special forces, troops, to train for air operations requiring free falls from airplanes.</p>

                                    <p>The facility opened in January of 2014 and, at 75 feet tall, is the largest in the world.</p>

                                    <p>Yuma’s military roots are extensive, and those traditions will not be slowing any time soon.</p>

                                    <p>Along with the number of Marines and sailors stationed at MCAS Yuma, estimates are that there are over 7,000 family members with them, approximately 1,300 civilian employees on base and most days, an additional 1,000 military members using the facility for training purposes.</p>

                                    <p>The Marine Corps Air Station annually hosts approximately 70 aviation units, bringing an average of 600 aircraft and 14,000 personnel for ongoing training that takes place throughout the year.<p>

                                            <p>With access to 2.8 million acres of bombing and aviation training ranges and superb flying weather, MCAS Yuma supports 80 percent of the Corps' air-to-ground aviation training.</p>

                                            <p>The Marine Corps Air Station Yuma economic impact on the local community in 2017 is over <strong>$653 million</strong>.</p>

                                            <p>Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) is the busiest United States Army testing center in the nation and a huge economic boon for surrounding communities in the District.</p>

                                            <p>The US Army Yuma Proving Ground generates an annual economic impact of over <strong>$450 million</strong>.</p>

                                            <p>YPG takes up about 20 percent of Yuma County and stretches north into La Paz County.</p>

                                            <p>YPG spans about 840,000 acres, the test center is about one-third the size of Massachusetts.</p>

                                            <p>About 1,700 employees, mostly civilians, test a wide variety of military hardware including unmanned aircraft, helicopter weapons, artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, machine guns, mortars, and parachutes.</p>

                                            <p>In a typical year at YPG, test personnel fire tens of thousands of artillery, mortar and missile rounds, 36,000 parachute drops take place, over 130,000 miles driven on test vehicles, and nearly 4,000 air sorties flown.</p>

                                            <p>MCAS has the F-35, and Yuma Proving Ground has the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.</p>

                                            <p>This testing environment would make the area a natural location for companies that supply the military and whose arms would need testing.</p>

                                            <p>Yuma County is also considered to have an advantage because of the high capacity port of entry at San Luis II, the Union Pacific Sunset Corridor, and Interstate 8.</p>

                                            <strong>Yuma County</strong>

                                            <p>The District’s economy has an unusual degree of stability, as the tourism base that many communities depend upon is relatively resistant to economic downturns.</p>

                                            <p>District tourism is either relatively low cost, access by motor vehicle recreational tourism from Southern California, and maintains through economic recession periods.</p>

                                            <p>Recessions only mildly impact winter visitor, snowbird, RV tourism, and the fixed income visitors.</p>

                                            <p>During the winter months, more than 100,000 winter visitors flock to the Yuma County communities to enjoy sun-drenched warmth.</p>

                                            <p>Arizona State Parks have a significant economic impact on communities and counties. A state park’s value is, of course, not measured by economic impact alone.</p>

                                            <p>Parks enhance community quality-of-life and preserve invaluable historical, cultural, and recreational resources for residents and visitors from around the world.</p>

                                            <p>However, communities are increasingly recognizing that State Parks improve the economic well-being of rural counties and serve as an essential tourism resource.</p>

                                            <p>Tourism is one of Yuma County's most prominent economic drivers, and Mexican visitors are an essential contributor.</p>

                                            <p>Travel and tourism continue to be among the most crucial export industries driving Arizona’s economy, and Mexican visitors are a primary contributor to this sector.</p>

                                            <p>Yuma County has 3% of the state’s population and 4.8% (3,534,832 acres or 5,523 square miles) of the state’s land base.</p>

                                            <p>This population density averages out to 29 people per square mile. The landscape is primarily the Sonoran Desert with low desert hills.</p>

                                            <p>Just across the state border into California is a vast region of massive, shifting dunes, a popular destination for many OHV enthusiasts.</p>

                                            <p>Tourism is the third biggest industry in Yuma County.</p>

                                            <p>According to documents obtained by the Yuma Visitor's Bureau, 2018 saw <strong>$653 million</strong> in Direct Travel Spending.</p>

                                            <p>That income created 6,400 jobs, generated <strong>$164.4 million</strong> in earnings and <strong>$50.8 million</strong> in additional taxes.</p>

                                            <p>Yuma has plenty to offer travelers and tourists alike. However, there is no doubt that Yuma's winters are some of the best in the country and draw the majority of visitors between November and Aril every year.</p>

                                            <p>Just how many winter visitors come tends to be an elusive number.</p>

                                            <p>At the peak of our winter visitor season, February, it is estimated we have about 80,000 visitors.</p>

                                            <p>February is the peak of the season as many places on the continent are experiencing some of their coldest temperatures.</p>

                                            <p>However, no matter the numbers, they have a significant impact on the area.</p>

                                            <p>Consider that the City of Yuma's year-round population is about 94,000.</p>

                                            <p>Adding another 80,000 is a significant seasonal influx of people to the community.</p>

                                            <p>Today's winter visitors are not quite the same breed as they were 25 years ago.</p>

                                            <p>Our nation’s youngest retirees come to Yuma and are highly active!</p>

                                            <p>They hit the casinos, browse the swap meets, attend arts and crafts shows, local patron events and fill seats at concerts.

                                                <p>They enjoy hiking in the desert, playing golf and fishing.</p>

                                                <p>They visit Mexico for medical and dental treatment and stay to linger over lunch and margaritas.</p>

                                                <strong><strong>Mexican Spending</strong></strong>

                                                <p>Mexican visitors spend an estimated <strong>$2.2 billion</strong> on food, clothing, entertainment, and other activities in Yuma County each year, according to a speaker at an economic forum in 2012.</p>

                                                <p>That represents more than 6 percent of all taxable sales. That spending directly supports more than 2,000 local jobs.</p>

                                                <strong>Air Access</strong>

                                                <p>Yuma, Bullhead City, Kingman, and Lake Havasu City have commercial rated airports.</p>

                                                <p>Yuma International Airport, a shared-use airport together with Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, is located three nautical miles south of the central business district of Yuma.</p>

                                                <p>Yuma International Airport is managed and operated by the Yuma County Airport Authority, Inc. (YCAA).</p>

                                                <p>Under Arizona law, an Airport Authority is an independent public agency and incorporated as a non-profit organization in the State of Arizona on December 30, 1965.</p>

                                                <p>The YCAA management team is composed of experienced aviation professionals and has a long history of providing support to the aviation and aerospace industry.</p>

                                                <p>Yuma International Airport offers reasonably frequent service (American Airlines) to important hubs (Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth).</p>

                                                <p>Connections to other destinations are relatively convenient, and airfares are not unreasonable.</p>

                                                <p>Federal Express is located on the airport; however, there are no large air cargo operations in Yuma.</p>

                                                <p>The Laughlin-Bullhead City Airport is a public airport located one mile north of the central business district of Bullhead City, in Mohave County.</p>

                                                <p>The airport is across the Colorado River and one block away from the community of Laughlin, Nevada.</p>

                                                <p>Many of the rooms at Laughlin's casino-hotels offer a view of the chartered and private flights that utilize the airport.</p>

                                                <p>No larger commercial airlines currently serve the airport.</p>

                                                <p>It was named 2011 Airport of the Year by the Arizona Department of Transportation.</p>

                                                <p>The airport is served by Republic Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.</p>

                                                <p>Flights to any destination are limited as to travel days and frequency.</p>

                                                <p>Bullhead City is also served by casino charter flights, which bring tourists to Laughlin from many cities around the country, but such trips do not provide for the general or business traveler. Air cargo facilities are not available.</p>

                                                <p>Kingman Airport is a city-owned public airport nine miles northeast of Kingman, in Mohave County.</p>

                                                <p>It has scheduled service on one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.</p>

                                                <p>Some aircraft are stored or scrapped there. Again, air cargo facilities are not available.</p>

                                                <p>The Lake Havasu City Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located six miles north of the central business district of Lake Havasu City, in Mohave County.</p>

                                                <p>The airport is mostly used for general aviation.</p>

                                                <p>Until May 5, 2007, scheduled service to Phoenix and Las Vegas was provided by Mesa Airlines, operating as US Airways Express. Again, air cargo facilities do not exist.</p>

                                                    <img src="images/jpg/route_66.jpg" alt="route 66 national historic trail in arizona" width="500" loading="lazy">
                                                    <figcaption>Route 66 National Historic Trail in Arizona</figcaption>

                                                </figure>

                                                <p>Three Interstates traverse the District.</p>

                                                <p>Interstate 40 goes east/west through Mohave County and through Kingman. Interstate 10 transits, east/west through La Paz County, and Quartzsite.</p>

                                                <p>Interstate 8 traverses southern Yuma County and the communities of Yuma and Wellton.</p>

                                                <p>These Interstate corridors provide excellent east/west access in and out of the District, linking the District to Tucson, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego.</p>

                                                <p>All provide viable commercial transportation corridors for trucking, and together constitute an advantageous situation for the District in serving these industrial markets.</p>

                                                <p>The only north/south transportation corridor within the District is US/AZ Highway 95, which goes from the Mexican border to Bullhead City, traversing San Luis, Somerton, Yuma, Quartzsite, Parker, and Lake Havasu City.</p>

                                                <p>The stretch from San Luis through Yuma is adequate, with some recent improvements having been made.</p>

                                                <p>This stretch is a viable commercial corridor. The completion of the Area Service Highway from the border at San Luis to Yuma will further facilitate commercial traffic and will help establish San Luis and Yuma County as a desirable location for commercial border crossings and industrial development.</p>

                                                <p>The route (State Route 195), locally known as the Area Service Highway (ASH) or Robert A. Vaughan Expressway, is designed to expedite the flow of commercial traffic between the United States and Mexico by channeling large tractor-trailers through the new port.</p>

                                                <p>And while construction lags on the Mexico side have delayed the opening of the port, the highway will, in the short term, provide a more direct route for motorists traveling between the border and east Yuma and the Foothills.</p>

                                                <p>Also, more immediately, the road should ease traffic congestion in Yuma by diverting the commercial tractor-trailers that currently travel on Yuma streets on the way to an Interstate 8 linkup.</p>

                                                <p>Planning for SR 195 began in the early 1990s. In January 1999, an intergovernmental agreement was approved between ADOT, Yuma County, the cities of Yuma and San Luis, the town of Wellton and the Cocopah Tribe.</p>

                                                <p>In 2000, voters approved $13.15 million in local funding as part of the Yuma County Capital Improvement half-cent sales tax, which has since been retired.</p>

                                                <p>The total cost of the 26-mile highway is $92 million. Work began on the SR 195 in late 2007, and sections of the road became opened to travel as they were completed.</p>

                                                <p>The corridor from Yuma north through Bullhead City is a very different picture.</p>

                                                <p>This portion of the US/AZ 95 corridor is subject to extreme seasonal variations in use in segments, with heavy tourist use during the winter months.</p>

                                                <p>US/AZ 95 is recognized as the busiest 2-lane highway in Arizona in 2019.</p>

                                                <p>While the condition of the road is adequate for the low traffic load periods of each year, the virtually complete lack of four-lane sections and passing lanes renders the highways unacceptable for commercial usage at any time of the year, but particularly during the tourist season.</p>

                                                <p>As there are no current plans to provide reasonable numbers of either four-lane sections or passing lanes in the foreseeable future, the lack of a viable north/south commercial corridor for the District is unlikely to be remedied.</p>

                                                <p>Communities lacking adequate access to the Interstate corridors include Parker, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Colorado City.</p>

                                                <p>The East/West transportation corridors give the District’s communities opportunity for more diversified industrial development.</p>

                                                <p>Interstates 8, 10, and 40 provide quick access by truck to the major urban centers of Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and the ports associated with Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>

                                                <p>East/West rail lines through La Paz County, Kingman, and Yuma also provide access to important markets.</p>

                                                <p>Conversely, lack of interstate and rail access creates difficulties for development in Bullhead City, Lake Havasu, and other District communities. North/South transportation corridors are not as advantageous.</p>

                                                <p>No rail lines run north/south through the District, all air travel is to/through Los Angeles or Phoenix (excepting flights from Bullhead City to a variety of destinations serving the Laughlin Casino industry).</p>

                                                <p>The main North/South highway US/AZ 95 is not constructed nor maintained at an appropriate service level for the heavy winter seasonal travel loads, creating dangerous and slow travel conditions for much of the year.</p>

                                                <p>Besides, US/AZ 95 is not an all-weather road, being bisected by 81 washes in the 81-mile stretch from Yuma to Quartzsite, creating flooding and closure problems during the infrequent rains.</p>

                                                <p>Currently, efforts are being made to have US/AZ 95 declared a western branch of the Canamex corridor, which may result in faster and more extensive upgrading, which is definitely needed to meet even current traffic loads.</p>

                                                <p>Isolation is not generally considered an economic asset. However, for some areas of the District, the relative isolation and substantial empty territory have been advantageous.</p>

                                                <p>There are getting to be fewer and fewer places where major power generation facilities can be sited without protest, or large military installations can be located without conflicting with other users.</p>

                                                <p>The District’s communities have benefited from being able to provide locations for both types of development.</p>

                                                <p>The Yuma Proving Ground and Marine Corps Air Station are located near Yuma and are an essential contributor to the Yuma County economy, providing over 8,000 jobs and more than <strong>$170 million</strong> in annual payroll.</p>

                                                <p>The District is also becoming a location for commercial power generation. Industrial power generators either already operating within the District include Yuma Co-Generation Associates in Yuma County and Griffith Energy in Mohave County.</p>

                                                <p>Desert Proving Ground Yuma is a facility co-built and leased by General Motors located within the US Army's Yuma Proving Ground.</p>

                                                <p>The site contains a private facility sitting on 2,400 acres with a 24-acre campus containing 98,000 square feet of building area and also has 40 miles of roadway.</p>

                                                <p>One of the main reasons that this site was chosen was the already imposed no-fly zone which helps prevent unwanted photography of pre-production prototypes undergoing testing. The facility is also used by the US Army for its own testing requirements.</p>

                                                <p>One of the factors attracting such developments and installations to the District is the relative isolation of much of the District land from major urban centers and the large, unpopulated areas in which such facilities can locate.</p>

                                                <p>The District has also provided sites for commercial testing grounds beside the US Army’s Yuma Proving Ground.</p>

                                                        <p>High unemployment remains an issue in Yuma. Citing April 2012 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as #2 among the 13 U.S. cities that post unemployment rates above 15 percent. By December 2017, the Yuma County unemployment rate barely improved to 14.3 percent.</p>

                                                        <p>Yuma's agricultural workforce, which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce.</p>

                                                        <p>Yuma County has always been seen as a lower wage area. Yuma County also chronically has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country at nearly 30 percent.</p>

                                                        <p>But many of the unemployed lack the training, skills, and certification to fill the better-paying jobs that are available.</p>

                                                        <p>Companies with the need for more skilled labor come to job fairs, only to leave empty-handed because they can't find qualified applicants.</p>

                                                        <p>Not only do available jobs go wanting for lack of qualified applicants, but it also means the area has trouble attracting companies that offer better-paying jobs.</p>

                                                        <p>Yuma County continues to be the destination for the lower-paying jobs. The area must have to have a higher skilled workforce to attract better-paying jobs.</p>

                                                        <p>On the other hand, the lack of higher-skilled jobs drives young people to leave the community to seek careers elsewhere.</p>

                                                        <p>And others who come to Yuma as the spouses of military and professionals often are unable to find a job here to match their skills.</p>

                                                        <p>The community has made some strides, such as the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, and math) program now being offered by Yuma Union High School District in partnership with Arizona Western College.</p>

                                                        <p>The college in collaboration with the University of Arizona also is making it easier for Yumans to pursue college degrees in such fields as engineering.</p>

                                                        <p>The top ten employers in Yuma County based on number of employees are: #1 US Army Proving Ground (YPG) (military); #2 Yuma Regional Medical Center (healthcare); #3 Yuma Elementary School District (education) #4 Wal-Mart Stores (retail); #5 City of Yuma (government); #6 Yuma County (government); #7 US Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) (military); #8 Bose Corporation (manufacturing); #9 US Border Patrol (government); and #10 ACT, Advanced Call Center Technologies (call center).</p>

                                                        <p>The unemployment rate in Yuma County is 16.0% (May 2018), with job growth of - 0.42%.</p>

                                                        <p>Future job growth over the next ten years is predicted to be 15.46%. For the same month, the metro unemployment rate was 22.1 percentage points higher than the Arizona rate.</p>

                                                                                                        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The District is a hub of entrepreneurial activity, but the actual job creation impact is minimal.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>This is where the <q>“rubber meets the road”</q> with corporate leadership.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>They are determined to diversify the economy. Further, champion innovation and target economic sectors with the long-term potential to avoid the peaks and valleys of the past.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>These are long-term strategies, whose benefits might not be seen for years.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Arizona generated substantial job gains in the fourth quarter of 2018, with employment increasing by 96,200 over the year according to the preliminary data.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>That translated into growth of 3.4%, which far outpaced the U.S. at 1.7%.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Most of the job growth was driven by construction, professional and business services, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>These four sectors alone accounted for 67.8% of net job gains over the year.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Note also that manufacturing added jobs at a solid clip.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>That is encouraging because those jobs tend to pay relatively high wages.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>According to the latest population estimates from the Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity, Arizona’s population hit 7,076,199 on July 1, 2018.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>The state added 110,302 residents from July 2017 to July 2018, which translated into a growth rate of 1.6%.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>That was slightly faster than the method-consistent rate of 1.5% in 2017.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>As usual, Arizona population growth far outpaced the U.S. at 0.7%.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>That forecast boils down to gradual deceleration from above-trend growth in 2018-2019 to trend growth by 2020.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Slowing growth this year is driven by the dissipation of the federal fiscal stimulus, the lagged impacts of past interest rate increases, uncertainty about the resolution of trade disputes, and decelerating global economic performance.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Interest rate spreads have been gradually narrowing during the expansion.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>While long-term rates are generally above short-term rates, this relationship is sometimes reversed during periods of monetary tightening.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>This is known as a yield-curve inversion, and when it happens, recessions often follow.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>The 10-year rate was 0.17 percentage points above the 2-year rate.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Substantial increases in employment, combined with tightening labor markets and a rising minimum wage, support continued wage and income growth.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>While the U.S. baseline outlook calls for continued growth, we should consider alternative scenarios. Given recent concerns about the ability of the U.S. economy to keep growing, let’s start with the pessimistic scenario.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>This story assumes two primary sources of trouble. The first is real estate prices, which are expected to turn slowing growth into outright declines.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>This damages consumer confidence and household spending pull back.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Further, an inverted yield curve hurts business confidence, resulting in falling stock prices and reduced nonresidential investment.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Overall, the pessimistic scenario generates a moderate three-quarter recession beginning in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>On a brighter note, the optimistic scenario assumes faster productivity growth, combined with a less inflation-prone labor market and an economy more tolerant of rising interest rates.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>This allows more rapid U.S. growth to be consistent with low inflation.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>The result is a stronger overall economic performance, with real GDP growth 1.1 percentage points above the baseline during the next decade.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Arizona’s growth depends in part on national economic performance.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>If the U.S. falls into recession, that will generate slower growth or a downturn in the state economy.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>A national decline of the sort envisioned under the pessimistic scenario would not produce a severe drop in economic activity in Arizona.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>In a similar vein, stronger U.S. performance would translate into a more robust state economy.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>A reasonable question is whether Yuma and Mohave Counties can sustain such population growth rates over the next 20 years.</p>

                                                                                                                <p>Both counties have most of their land area tied up in federal, state, and tribal land ownership, with many cities and towns being effectively <q>landlocked.’</q>

                                                                                                                    <p>Yet these counties are very sizable in geographic extent, being among the largest counties in the state and country.<p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The planned urban density developments for Mohave County show that such counties can absorb such population growth.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>It should also be recognized that tribal land is available for development, even if such development may be more difficult in some ways than for property in private ownership.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Both Yuma and Mohave County clearly have enough developable land to grow at these rates for the foreseeable future.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>A more likely limit to growth will be water availability. At the present time, both Yuma and Mohave Counties have sufficient water to handle a population of 500,000.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>In Mohave County, development of non-Colorado River resources may be necessary, but water should not severely limit growth up to a population total of at least 500,000.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>One potential for the expansion of water resources for residential development is the transfer of water rights from agricultural users to residential use.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>In Yuma County, the vast majority of water rights, many senior rights, reside with agricultural producers; in Mohave County, agriculture is much less extensive, but this still presents a potential for transference to residential use.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The issue with water is less, can it be made available, than it is, what will it cost.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>As the population grows, water will start exerting pressure to limit growth through its increasing expense, more than through its availability.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Both counties should be able to achieve a population of at least 500,000 before water limitations begin to be felt.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>In Mohave County, development seems to have several centers.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The two existing population centers of Kingman/Golden Valley and Bullhead City have seen massive developments announced for their communities.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Lake Havasu is currently the fastest growing city in the county and should continue to see significant growth in the future, though it may be passed by Bullhead City as the county’s largest incorporated city.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Interstate 11 (I-11) is a north-south Interstate Highway tentatively planned to run from Nogales, Arizona, to Reno, Nevada, along with the current routes of Interstate 19, Interstaten10, US 93 and US 95.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Currently, the only open section of I-11 is a 22.845-mile-long (36.765 km) freeway running predominantly northwest-southeast in the U.S. state of Nevada that follows presently U.S. Route 93 (US 93) and U.S. Route 95 (US 95) between the Arizona state line and Henderson.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The bulk of the route is still in the early discussion and planning stages. Except for the portion between Wickenburg, Arizona to Hoover Dam, which will run on an upgraded US 93 (including its concurrency with I-40), an exact route for I-11 has yet to be determined. Some corridor alternatives have been identified for further study and refinement.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>As initially proposed in 2012 Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, the highway would only run from Casa Grande, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, via Kingman and Buckeye, Arizona.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>This was to provide a direct Interstate link between the Las Vegas and Phoenix metropolitan areas, which are currently the two largest adjacent American cities lacking a direct freeway link.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>However, extensions of the corridor to the north towards Reno and to the south towards Tucson, Arizona have since been approved.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The proposed numbering of this highway does not fit within the usual conventions of the existing Interstate Highway grid as, at least in the initial phase south of Las Vegas, it would be entirely east of Interstate 15 and should, therefore, have a number higher than 15.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>But Interstate 17 was already built to the east of the Interstate 11 alignment in Arizona, making it impossible to fit this freeway's interstate number into the national grid and remain within the traditional numbering convention.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The subsequent plan to extend the Interstate north of Las Vegas to Reno would, if constructed, put that portion of Interstate 11 west of Interstate 15 and thus in line with the national grid numbering conventions.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Opened in 2010, it was the critical component of the Hoover Dam Bypass project, which rerouted US 93 from its previous routing along the top of Hoover Dam and removed several hairpins turns and blind curves from the route.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>It is jointly named for Mike O'Callaghan, Governor of Nevada from 1971–1979, and Pat Tillman, an American football player who left his career with the Arizona Cardinals to enlist in the United States Army and was later killed in Afghanistan by friendly fire.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>As early as the 1960s, officials identified the US 93 route over Hoover Dam to be dangerous and inadequate for projected traffic volumes.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>In March 2001, the Federal Highway Administration selected the route, which crosses the Colorado River approximately 1,500 feet (460 m) downstream of Hoover Dam.</p>

The bridge was completed in 2010, and the entire bypass route opened to vehicle traffic on October 19, 2010.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>The Hoover Dam Bypass project was completed within budget at the cost of $240 million; the bridge portion cost $114 million.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>San Luis is growing at a very rapid pace, and this seems to be continuing. At current growth rates, San Luis may be challenging Yuma for the privilege of being the county’s biggest city within 20 years.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Growth further east, in the Wellton area, may also dramatically increase.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Yuma County will likely see significant development limited to the small southwest corner of the county where past growth has occurred.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>This would be the City of Yuma south to the Mexican border, and the border community of San Luis, and east to Wellton. Major development north of the City of Yuma and east of Wellton is unlikely.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Physical shocks are those who, cause harm to either built or natural environment or both, such as a hurricane, or an oil spill.</p>

                                                                                                                            <p>Obviously, physical shocks are economic in nature as well.</p>

Dependent upon a short, intense show season, and elderly, RV driving winter visitors, Quartzsite tourism can be expected to follow a different pattern.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>Some Quartzsite sources have stated that show attendance was reduced this year, while others say it increased; apparently, the number of vendors offering at the shows was reduced from levels of recent years.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>The longer-term winter visitor population stayed stable. Winter visitors to Quartzsite are likely to be fixed income of modest means and would not see income from pensions or social security impacted by economic cycles.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>Visitors for the show period may be a different group to some extent – but it is still RV tourism and primarily elderly.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>Again, access to Quartzsite is by driving, and Southern California provides a population base to draw upon, though Quartzsite tourism is likely to attract visitors from more diverse origins</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>A reasonable level of stability under economic downturns is expected, though show tourism may prove to be highly volatile and subject to surges and declines caused by non-economic factors.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>The winter visitor population seems quite stable and possibly growing. Seasonality of economic activity in Quartzsite is extreme, with as many as 2 million visitor days crammed into two months of the year.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>This tourism surge period preceded and followed by a much more moderate level of longer-term winter visitors, which effectively more than doubles the town’s population, then a five to six-month period of virtually no tourism or economically productive activity at all.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>The Quartzsite population is quite elderly and has the country’s third oldest population (34.9 percent) over 65, according to U.S. Census Bureau county population estimates in 2013.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>Having more than half the people at retirement age means many residents have fixed retirement income, which can provide a stable base for the community.</p>

                                                                                                                                                        <p>However, the age of the population as a whole means that people and economic decline may occur if Quartzsite cannot continue to attract a steady influx of retirees.</p>
